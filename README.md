# FUTURE_CS_02 â€“ Social Engineering & Phishing Simulation

## Task Overview
This repository contains my work for Task 2 of the Future Interns Cyber Security Internship Program. The objective was to simulate a phishing attack using a cloned login page.

## Simulation Setup
- Tool: Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)
- OS: Kali Linux 
- Network: Localhost simulation

## Steps Followed
1. Launched SET Toolkit and chose appropriate attack vectors.
2. Cloned the target site using the Credential Harvester method.
3. Hosted the page on the local network (http://192.168.1.9).
4. Captured credentials submitted on the fake page.

## Deliverables
- Report (PDF)
- Screenshots (email preview, terminal hit)
- README (this file)

## Learnings
- Practical exposure to phishing simulation.
- Understanding of how phishing kits work.
- Importance of employee awareness and preventive measures.
